# The Secret History Of NFTs

**NFT** — **non-fungible token**.

If you were paying attention to the art-scene in 2021 and 2022, then you have probably heard that name — **NFT**.

But what is an **NFT**?

## The Layman's View

To many people, NFTs are a form a digital-art.
With styles that range
from cartoon drawings of cartoon ape heads,
to pixel-art inspired by videos games of the 1970s and 1980s,
to ####,
and ####.

**TODO: include some samples of NFTs**

But NFTs have an interesting history that goes back quite a bit earlier than 2021!
And the the early NFTs had absoltely nothing to do with art!

## Why NFTs

There are a lot of things that culminated in creating the popularity of **NFTs**.

### Professional Video Gaming

Video games have a history going back to the 1970s.
A history that has gone through many eras.

Today (at the time of writing of this article) playing video games online over the Internet is popular.

Also, today (at the time of writing this article) _watching others_ play videos games over the Internet is popular too.

Today millions of people watch other people play video games!

Watching-others-play-video-games is similar to how, in the past, audiences were drawn to watch professional athletes play various (physical) sports, such as — baseball, basketball, cricket, football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, etc.

But instead of those (physical) sports, audience members, that can number in the millions of people, watch other people play video games such as — Dota, Fortnite, Hearthstone, Quake, Street Fighter, etc.

Popular platform to watch other people play videos games include Twitch, and YouTube.
Less popular, but up-and-coming platforms, include a network of federated platforms that collectively get called the Fediverse.

Like with music, art, and other Pareto distributed fields — most people in the industry make little to no money — but a tiny fraction make a almost all the money. A tiny fraction of professional gamers make hundred-of-thousands of dollars (not per year, but) per month.

There are two types of activities for these professional gamers —

1. play videos games and record it or let other watch you live, and
2. competitively play videos games against others.

This latter form of activity is called eSports.
