# The Secret History Of NFTs

**NFT** — **non-fungible token**.

If you were paying attention to the art-scene in 2021 and 2022, then you have probably heard that name — **NFT**.

But what is an **NFT**?

## The Layman's View

To many people, NFTs are a form a digital-art.
With styles that range
from cartoon drawings of ape heads,
to pixel-art inspired by videos games of the 1970s and 1980s,
to ####,
and ####.

**TODO: include some samples of NFTs**

But NFTs have an interesting history that goes back quite a bit earlier than 2021!
And the the early NFTs had absoltely nothing to do with art!

## Why NFTs

There are a lot of things that culminated in creating the popularity of **NFTs**.

And many of these things are largely unrelated.

Today NFTs are, in the minds of many many people, almost synonymous with a certain type of digital art.
But, strictly speaking, NFTs are not art-specific.

The history of NFTs runs through video games, and virtual goods; but also includes things like legal contract signing, and property ownership.

## Professional Video Gaming

Video games have a history going back to the 1970s.
A history that has gone through many eras.

Today (at the time of writing of this article) playing video games online over the Internet is popular.

Also, today (at the time of writing this article) _watching other people_ play videos games over the Internet is popular too.

Today millions of people watch other people play video games!

Watching-others-play-video-games is similar to how, in the past, audiences were drawn to watch professional athletes play various (physical) sports, such as — baseball, basketball, cricket, football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, etc.

But instead of those (physical) sports, audience members, that can number in the millions of people, watch other people play video games such as — Dota, Fortnite, Hearthstone, Quake, Street Fighter, etc.

Popular platform to watch other people play videos games include Twitch, and YouTube.
Less popular, but up-and-coming platforms, include a network of federated platforms that collectively get called the Fediverse.

Like with music, art, and other Pareto distributed fields — most people in the industry make little to no money — but a tiny fraction make a almost all the money. A tiny fraction of professional gamers make hundred-of-thousands of dollars (not per year, but) per month.

There are two types of activities for these professional gamers —

1. play videos games and record it or let other watch you live, and
2. competitively play videos games against others.

This latter form of activity is called eSports.

One video game that has been popular for eSports is Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone video game.

There has been a history of Hearthstone competitions going back to 2013.

### Crowd Funding

Many of the teams who created blockchain games were small and independent.

It wasn't in the means of the team member to take a year or two off from the (previous) work, and focus on creating a video game.

## HunterCoin

A very notable early blockchain gaming is a game by the name of — HunterCoin.

The HunterCoin blockchain video game was released in 2014.

An interesting quality of Huntercoin is that, the game actually ran on the blockchain.

Something that seems unfathomable to today's Ethereum based NFTs that also have a video game component. 

## Video Game Blockchains

Although the HunterCoin blockchain video game was a success both as a video game, and for its technology, one thing some people felt was a short-coming of its technology was that — its blockchain could only be used to play one video game.

What if you wanted to create a new video game?
Would you have to create your own new blockchain?
Why can't you just use a single blockchain for multiple video games?

Three separate companies formed in an effort to try to address this short-coming —

* Enjin
* Loom
* Xaya

## Oppotunists

What eventually became known as NFTs started with the software developers & futurists, with the video game developers & the fans, with the artists & the dreamers.

But when (what were then) outsiders (to these communities that embraced NFTs) noticed that there was opportunity — it attracted the opportunists.

When there is rapidly increasing opportunities it tends to attact opportunists.

These opportunists had little to no interest in the cultures, the ethos, or the communities that had embraced NFTs.

These opportunists were looking for a quick buck, and to get-rich-quick.

## Post-Opportunists

Rapidly increasing opportunity attracting opportunitists is nothing new.

We have seen this over and over and over again in other fields and industries.

The oppotunists came and went.
But that field and industry is not only still there, but it is extremely successful.

### Dot-com Boom

The late-1990s and early-2000s saw the Internet & the Web start to go mainstream.
No longer was it only the domain of software developers, computer enthusiasts, researchers, and ####.

In the late-1990s and early-2000s normal people started coming online; using the Internet, the Web, e-mail, as well as other platforms that were popular at the time.

The Dot-com Boom and bust came and went.
And with it the opportunists came and went.

But the Internet, the Web, and e-mail are still here.

And not only that — the Internet, the Web, and e-mail are extremely successful!

The modern Internet brought us new things — Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Careem, eBay, Facebook, Google, Instagram,, Lyft Naver, Netflix, PayPal, Shopify Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Yahoo! — to name a small number of them.

The early Internet and Web attracted opportunists.
But the opportunitsts eventually went away.
And not only is the Internet and Web still here, but it is extremely successfull.

### Linux / Open Source Boom

Linux is a free and open source computer operating system.

Linux is probably most similar to the Unix operating system.
But Linux the same _type_ of technology as Microsoft Windows, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

When the Internet and the Web went mainstream, in the late-1990s and early-2000s, Linux played a major role.
