# The Secret History Of NFTs

**NFT** — **non-fungible token**.

If you were paying attention to the art-scene in 2021 and 2022, then you have probably heard that name — **NFT**.

But what is an **NFT**?

## The Layman's View

To many people, NFTs are a form a digital-art.
With styles that range
from cartoon drawings of cartoon ape heads,
to pixel-art inspired by videos games of the 1970s and 1980s,
to ####,
and ####.

**TODO: include some samples of NFTs**

But NFTs have an interesting history that goes back quite a bit earlier than 2021!
And the the early NFTs had absoltely nothing to do with art!
