# The Secret History Of NFTs

**NFT** — **non-fungible token**.

If you were paying attention to the art-scene in 2021 and 2022, then you have probably heard that name — **NFT**.

But what is an **NFT**?

## The Layman's View

To many people, NFTs are a form a digital-art.
With styles that range
from cartoon drawings of ape heads,
to pixel-art inspired by videos games of the 1970s and 1980s,
to ####,
and ####.

**TODO: include some samples of NFTs**

Some of these go by names such as — Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Cool Cats, CryptoPunks, as well as many others.

But NFTs have an interesting history that goes back quite a bit earlier than 2021!
And the early NFTs had absoltely nothing to do with art!

## Why NFTs

There are a lot of things that culminated in creating the popularity of **NFTs**.
Many of these things being largely unrelated to each other.

Today NFTs are, in the minds of many many people, almost synonymous with a certain type of digital art.
But, strictly speaking, although NFTs can be used for art, they are not art-specific, and have nothing (directly) to do with art.

The history of NFTs runs through video games, and virtual goods; but also includes things like legal contract signing, and property ownership.

## Professional Video Gaming

Video games have a history going back to the 1970s.
A history that has gone through many eras.

Today (at the time of writing of this article) playing video games online over the Internet is popular.

Also, today (at the time of writing this article) _watching other people_ play videos games over the Internet is popular too.

Today millions of people watch other people play video games!

Watching-others-play-video-games is similar to how, in the past, audiences were drawn to watch professional athletes play various (physical) sports, such as — baseball, basketball, cricket, football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, etc.

But instead of those (physical) sports, audience members, that can number in the millions of people, watch other people play video games such as — Dota, Fortnite, Hearthstone, Quake, Street Fighter, etc.

Popular platform to watch other people play videos games include Twitch, and YouTube.
Less popular, but up-and-coming platforms, include a network of federated platforms that collectively get called the Fediverse.

Like with music, art, and other Pareto distributed fields — most people in the industry make little to no money — but a tiny fraction make a almost all the money. A tiny fraction of professional gamers make hundred-of-thousands of dollars (not per year, but) per month.

There are two types of activities for these professional gamers —

1. play videos games and record it or let other watch you live, and
2. competitively play videos games against others.

This latter form of activity is called eSports.

## eSports

eSports (which is short for “electronic sports”) is a form of professional competitive (video) gaming.

This could take the form of a series of one-on-one competitions, with the eSports players fighting each other in the Street Fighter video game.

Or, it could take the form of two teams going head-to-head against each other in a game League of Legends; where the winner gets a $1 million prize.

Often these competitions take place in an eSports arena, with a large area in the eSports arena for audience members to sit and watch the professional eSports players compete against each other.

Sometimes these matches are also broadcast over the Internet.
Sometimes recording of the matches are put on the Internet.

eSports is an industry now.
There are people who make their living from eSports.
And it has been around long enough that some people have even retired from eSports.

eSports team is more than just the players/
There are coaches.
There are cooks (who make food for the team).
Drivers (who drive the team around).
Etc.

## Blitzchung Controversy

One video game that has been popular for eSports is Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone video game.

There has been a history of Hearthstone competitions going back to 2013.

### Crowd Funding

Many of the teams who created blockchain games were small and independent.

It wasn't in the means of the team member to take a year or two off from the (previous) work, and focus on creating a video game.

## HunterCoin

A very notable early blockchain game is a video game by the name of — HunterCoin.

HunterCoin is a video game, a blockchain, and a cryptocurrency,
that has its origins back in 2013 and was released back in 2014.

The HunterCoin video game is a massively-multiplayer-online-gaming (MMOG).
It consists of a top-down 2D virtual world can invoke nostalgic feelings for the video game Gauntlet from the 1980s.


The HunterCoin blockchain was a based on the software source code of the Namecoin blockchain.
Which itself was based on the software source code of the Bitcoin blockchain.
The HunterCoin blockchain is a _human-minable_ cryptocurrency,
where (as a rule of thumb) the more human-effort that is put in (by the human), the more reward.

An interesting quality of the HunterCoin video game is that, the HunterCoin video game actually ran on the blockchain.

Compare this to most other blockchain games even today (at the time of writing of this article) which only store the the ownership of profile images, and in-game virtual goods on the blockchain.
HunterCoin was ahead of its time!

This feat that HunterCoin pulled off — of being able to actual run the game on the blockchain — is something that seems (in practice) unfathomable to today's Ethereum based NFTs based video games.

## Video Game Blockchains

Although the HunterCoin blockchain video game was a success both as a video game, and for its technology, one thing some people felt was a short-coming of its technology was that — its blockchain could only be used to play one video game.

What if you wanted to create a new video game?
Would you have to create your own new blockchain?
Why can't you just use a single blockchain for multiple video games?

Three separate companies formed in an effort to try to address this short-coming —

* Enjin
* Loom
* Xaya

## Oppotunists

What eventually became known as NFTs started with the software developers & futurists, with the video game developers & the fans, with the artists & the dreamers.

But when (what were then) outsiders (to these communities that embraced NFTs) noticed that there was opportunity — it attracted the opportunists.

When there is rapidly increasing opportunities it tends to attact opportunists.

These opportunists had little to no interest in the cultures, the ethos, or the communities that had embraced NFTs.

These opportunists were looking for a quick buck, and to get-rich-quick.

## Post-Opportunists

Rapidly increasing opportunity attracting opportunitists is nothing new.

We have seen this over and over and over again in other fields and industries.

The oppotunists came and went.
But that field and industry is not only still there, but it is extremely successful.

### Dot-com Boom

The late-1990s and early-2000s saw the Internet & the Web start to go mainstream.
No longer was it only the domain of software developers, computer enthusiasts, researchers, and ####.

In the late-1990s and early-2000s normal people started coming online; using the Internet, the Web, e-mail, as well as other platforms that were popular at the time.

TODO

The Dot-com Boom and bust came and went.
And with it the opportunists came and went.

But the Internet, the Web, and e-mail are still here.

And not only that — the Internet, the Web, and e-mail are extremely successful!

The modern Internet brought us new things — Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Careem, eBay, Facebook, Google, Instagram,, Lyft Naver, Netflix, PayPal, Shopify Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Yahoo! — to name a small number of them.

The early Internet and Web attracted opportunists.
But the opportunitsts came and eventually went away.
But not only is the Internet and Web still here, but it is extremely successful.

### Linux / Open Source Boom

Linux is a free and open source computer operating system.

Linux is probably most similar to the Unix operating system.
But Linux the same _type_ of technology as Microsoft Windows, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

When the Internet and the Web went mainstream, in the late-1990s and early-2000s, Linux played a major role.

TODO

The Linux / Open Source Book attracted opportunists.
But the opportunists came and eventually went away.
But not only is the Linux and open source still here, but they are extremely successful!

Most computer servers that power the Internet and the Web run on Linux.
Most mobile phones (i.e., Android based mobile phones) run on Linux.
Etc.

And that is just Linux.
WordPress, another example of open source software technology, (at the time of writing this article) powers about 43% of the Web.
(Interestingly, usually this is the WordPress software running on a computer server that itself is running Linux.)

There are many other examples.

## NFT Use-Case

TODO

### Digital Prints

Some artist want to be able to create the digital version of a “print”.

With traditional (physical) prints —
An artist, who paints, might create a painting, but not want to sell the original.
Instead the artist might take a very high quality, high resolution photo of their painting, and print that onto very high quality paper.
This is called a print.
Usually these artists restrict how many prints they create — maybe 20, or 50, or 100, or 1,000.
They sell these (physical) prints.

Some artists see NFTs as a way of creating the digital version of these prints.

## What An Actuall NFT Is

In its most fundemental sense, an NFT is just a type _record_ — a thing that acts as evidence about the past.

TODO

We are aware that humans have been keeping _records_ written records to thousands of years.

Some of the earliest forms of writing — called Cuneiform — was made from wedge-shaped immpressions pushed into (soft) clay (that was later hardened).
Many of these Cuneiform clays amounted to _records_.

TODO

Fast forward to today, and we are still creating _records_.

We have electronic computers now, so our records less often put on clay tablets, and more ofen put on a computer.

NFTs are one technique for creating a record on a computer.
